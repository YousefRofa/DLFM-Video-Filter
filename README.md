### Notes:
- A Conda Environment is needed for running the code.
The environment is located in the [environment.yml](environment.yml) file and instructions on how to install conda and 
activate the environment can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

- If you face issues due to numpy being incompatible with bioformats, uninstall numpy then reinstall numpy==1.26.4 instead.
